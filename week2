# Operations on numbers:

### Task 1: 

Lamborghini Aventador has a wheel-base of 2.6 m and an average track-width of 1.7 m. 
The Foot-print of a car is the area covered by the four points of the car's wheels touching the ground and
is given by the equation foot-print = (wheel-base * track-width). 

Your task is to create two variables namely track-width and wheel-base and assign respective values to them. 
Write an equation to calcuate the foot-print and print the result.

**Note:** Keep in mind the rules for assigning names for variables.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

wheel_base = 2.6
track_width = 1.7

foot_print = (wheel_base * track_width)

print(foot_print)

### Task 2: 

Time to collision (TTC) of a vehicle is the time available for the vehicle to brake or 
execute a manoeuvre to avoid collision with the object in front.  It is given by a simple formula, 
TTC = distance of separation / current velocity of the vehicle. 
Given the distance of separation between your Ferrari Roma and the Mini Cooper in front is 5 m and you are travelling at 2 m/s. 
Calculate the TTC and print it.

**Note:** Keep in mind the rules for assigning names for variables.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

distance = 5
velocity = 2

time_to_collision = distance / velocity

print(time_to_collision)

### Task 3:

The above task gives a value in Decimals. For the present task, try to get TTC value without a remainder.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

distance = 5
velocity = 2

time_to_collision = distance // velocity

print(time_to_collision)

### Task 4:

You have 10 friends and 2 Bentley Continental GTs. You are going to a party and each Bentley Continental GT can accommodate 4 people. 
How many of your friends will have to be left behind and will have to catch a bus? 

**Note:** You don't have to create any variables here. Use the print statement to display the result.

**Hint:** Solve it using the modulus **%** operator

# Your code below:
# -------------------

print(10 % (4*2))

### Task 5:

You are a billionaire who owns 10 BMW S1000RRs. You have 8 best friends and would like to gift each of them a BMW S1000RR. 
After this how many BMW S1000RRs will be left with you?

**Note:** You don't have to create any variables here. Use the print statement to display the result.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

print(10-8)


# String operations:

### Task 1:

Concatenate three string values namely, I am studying** , \<your course here\> and at THI.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

print("I am studying" + " " + "International Automotive Engineering" + " " + "at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt")

### Task 2:

Create a variable named sample and assign a string value of Yo to it. Now multiply the string with 4 and print the value.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

sample = "Yo"
print(sample*4)

### Task 3:

Create a variable called my_string and give it a string value I am in love with "Python". Print the string.

**Note:** Please pay attention to the double quotes " ". How will you handle it?

# Your code below:
# -------------------

## Solution:
print("I am in love with \"Python\"")

# Operator Precedence:

The operator precedence in Python follows the standard BODMAS (Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction)** rule. 
Other names are also used namely PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction) or BIDMAS 
(Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) depending in the country of residence.

Try to solve the following tasks by hand and also using Python to see if Python is getting the results right :

### Task 1:

The formula for tire diameter is given as  tire diameter = 2 x (section width x aspect ratio)/25.4 + rim diameter. Let section_width be 235 mm, aspect_ratio be 0.35 
amd rim_diameter be **19** inch. Write an expression to calcuate the **tire_diameter** and print the value.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

tire_diameter = 2 * (235 * 0.35) / 25.4 + 19
print(tire_diameter

### Task 2:

An Audi A8 has a bore of 0.845m and a stroke of 0.89m. The Volume of the cylinder is given 
be volume = (3.14/4)\* bore** * stroke. Calculate the volume of the cylinder.

**Hint:** Values can be directly substituted without any conversion.

# Your code below:
# -------------------

bore = 0.845
stroke = 0.89

volume = (3.14/4) * (bore**2) * stroke 
print(volume)

**Hint:** Values can be directly substituted without any conversion.
